# Pocketbase



For this app I have created a **custom build** of pocketbase which requires you to build it locally, and use the schema. You can customise the schema to you liking but **be aware of certain requirements in the main.go for table names etc.**

Build: [https://github.com/jfmow/pocketbase](https://github.com/jfmow/pocketbase)
