# Introduction

So you've come across this github project and are wondering... how do I even use this?

Well to make it as simple as posible I tried to build it as simple as posible. Buuut that doesn't always work so this guide is here to help.

Theres 3 parts to this guide, Pocketbase, Enviroment, and Emails.
In each part I explain what they are and how to do everything, and by the end you will be fully setup with Note.
